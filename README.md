#### Lab 28, 30: Notes App

This app uses the React library to implement a basic router.  The app itself allows for the creation, updating and deleting of "notes". Notes are saved to localStorage between sessions.

Cypress.io testing was added for Lab 30.  run "npm run cypress" to start the desktop GUI, then run the notes-app.spec.js test suite.

See the About (landing) page for instructions. It's pretty obvious.
